=             Step 5: Compiling the Generated Code                  =
=====================================================================

While we generate a valid Java file, it still won't be compiled yet. To do this we
will need to tell Maven to add the code we generate to the compiler input.

To achieve this we need to inject the Maven project descriptor into our plugin. This
can be done in the same way as any other parameter (just use "${project}" as the
expression. To use it we need to add a new dependency, though. The type of the
parameter is "MavenProject", which is defined in the new dependency added to the
plugin: org.apache.maven:maven-project.

This object gives us access to a lot of the configuration of the build -- both read
and write access is provided. In our case we just want to add a new directory to the
compilation sources, which requires us calling the corresponding method.

??? I still haven't found any good reference on this step. The API docs are useless,
providing nothing but a short detail without context on the class level. I haven't
seen any tutorial or similar documentation, I've learnt this myself from reading
source of other plugins.
