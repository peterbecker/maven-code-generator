=====================================================================

Chances are that the generated code will at some stage depend on external
libraries or some custom code such as base classes. If the code generation
is to be used only in a single project, then it can be sufficient to just
let that project pull in the dependencies. In other cases it is better to
manage the dependencies as part of the generator project, though.

The approach we will take is to add another module into the Maven project
that will manage the external dependencies and also offer a convenient
place to put the internal ones (base classes, etc.). Any project that
uses the generator plugin will then also have to depend on this module,
but nothing else. The versioning is kept consistent by sharing the same
parent project.
