=====================================================================

As a first step we just replicate a standard "Hello World" plugin. This will show how a plugin
is defined and used. It will also establish the first part of our overall project structure:
the plugin will be defined in a module inside the top-level project (called the "parent project").

A Maven plugin is mostly just a subclass of Maven's AbstractMojo class implementing the
execute() method with the code to be run when the plugin is run. Apart from extending that
particular class a tag "@goal" has to be placed in the JavaDoc for the class itself. This
takes the name of the goal to run as an argument.

To make it compile two steps have to be taken in the POM: (1) declare the module to be packaged
as "maven-plugin" and (2) depend on maven-plugin-api.

Once this has been set up, the plugin can be run by explicitly calling it with a fully qualified
goal:

  mvn MavenCodeGenerator:plugin:1.0:sayhi

This is a bit awkward, but we won't actually be doing this apart from this initial testing.
