Welcome to the Maven Code Generator tutorial.

This little project is designed to guide you through all steps required to create a code generator that
is integrated with the Maven lifecycle. It will cover a number of technologies to achieve that goal.
The documentation will only point out the knowledge essential for the project, but there will be pointers
for further reading.

The idea of this project is to use version control to show how a project like this evolves. Each step in
creating the generator is checked in as a named version (a.k.a. 'tag') in git. This makes it possible to
see the project grow and use diffs to see what exactly was changed. The target audience is experienced
Java developers, but there should be enough references in each step to allow less experienced developers
to catch up on all relevant topics.

The folder containing this file will collect text files describing each step. These will appear before
each corresponding step, describing an outline of what will be done. They then get expanded to describe
the actual change.

At this point in time the project is just an empty Maven project, with the project description file (POM)
and this documentation file as well as the description of what step 1 will be. To continue you should
have some basic understanding of git and Maven (see the references below). Time to go on to step 1, which
is outlined in 'step01.txt'.
