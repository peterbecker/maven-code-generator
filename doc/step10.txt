=====================================================================

In this last proper step of our tutorial we will flesh out the example a
little bit. As mentioned earlier we are not trying to generate a full ORM
layer, but we will add some simple DAOs to demonstrate how easy it is to
generate multiple files. The DAOs will also use a base class that will be
provided by the base module.

The new code shows how the development can be split into a base library
(or framework) and the generated code. We now also generate two files per
entity. This approach can be extended to generate all necessary classes
for a multi-tier architecture.

The testing has become more meaningful, too. We don't just test a simple
getter, the new test integrates the generated code with Hibernate and an
in-memory database. Again this approach can be extended to cover a full
multi-tier architecture.
