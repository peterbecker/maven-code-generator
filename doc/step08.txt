=====================================================================

So far we have only done manual inspection of the generated code. This is of
course not really scalable, we should be testing the code generator in some
automated fashion.

Given that its function is to generate working Java code, the most effective
testing is to ensure that the generated code works as expected. We could instead
compare the files generated to some sample files stored, but that tends to be
very brittle and does not actually cover the actual intent of the code generator.

So to test the code generator we will write normal JUnit tests exercising the
generated code.

The new test is written the same way we would test normal code that was hand-
written instead of generated. Obviously we wouldn't normally test such trivial
functionality, but for now this serves as an example how tests can be written.
